-- use SQL to do calculations for you. Suppose you only want records from 2015 with life_expectancy above 1.15 * avg_life_expectancy. You could use the following SQL query.

SELECT *
FROM populations
WHERE life_expectancy > 1.15 * avg_life_expectancy
  AND year = 2015;

SELECT *
FROM populations
-- Filter for only those populations where life expectancy is 1.15 times higher than average
WHERE life_expectancy > 1.15 *
  (SELECT AVG(life_expectancy)
   FROM populations
   WHERE year = 2015) 
    AND year = 2015;

-- Select relevant fields from cities table
select name, country_code, urbanarea_pop
from cities
-- Filter using a subquery on the countries table
where name in (select capital from countries)
ORDER BY urbanarea_pop DESC;
